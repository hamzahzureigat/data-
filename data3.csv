He is a technophile and forward-thinking, which is why I always thought it was weird that he was often dismissing of EVs on his podcast. I am glad that @elonmusk appears to have convinced him to buy a Performance Model S https://t.co/sOqMdZkPS0",95,1029

You CANNOT stream, vote or do anything on Melon WITHOUT A VERIFIED Melon account. 

You can ONLY BUY a VERIFIED Melon account as a Melon account requires verification by Korean phone number. 

p/s: EVS does not give away free Melon accounts

If Mercedes, Jaguar, BMW, or anyone else could have made a better car by now, ICE or EV, they would have. This isn't about ""EV competition"". We've seen the competition for years, and it's lame.  $TSLA",47,226

2018-08-05 10:01:15+00:00,106Euan,"Thought of the day: some people claim that EVs are more expensive to buy:

Toyota Prius: ¬£24,245
Nissan LEAF: ¬£25,190

Are you really going to quibble over ¬£945, which you'll save in Year 1 alone?

Audi A8: ¬£69,415
Tesla Model S: ¬£67,950

The electric premium option is cheaper! https://t.co/q6xioTdZZg",37,84
